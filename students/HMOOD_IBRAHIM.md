# MR-1: A new way to kill cancer cells

## Description
While looking at new ways to detect and treat bacterial infections, researchers at Cardiff University accidentally discovered a gene that could be responsible for detecting and killing cancer cells.
By using CRISPR to delete genes from immune cells, scientists were able to find that a gene (called the MR1 gene) helps find cancer cells. The scientists who discovered this found that
it can be used to discover and kill prostate, breast, lung, and many more cancer cells. While these findings have not been tested on human patients, they have been tested on mice that
were given human cancers. The researchers also discovered that the immune cells that were given or had the gene also left healthy, non-cancerous cells alone.
While it might not be able to detect and kill all cancers, the discovery of this gene could mean more universal treatments, as current cancer treatments are patient-specific with some level of
universallity.
