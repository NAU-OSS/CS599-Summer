**News Channel**: *Fox News Channel*
Apple held its annual developer’s conference on Monday, announcing new software upgrades for all of its devices. IOS, which is the operating system that runs on your 
iPhone, has received what can be considered the biggest upgrade to date. Apple has infused it with artificial intelligence meaning it is now more capable and 
feature-rich. IOS 18 is also more customizable than ever, giving you the ability to tweak your home screen and more. Apple Intelligence is a "personal intelligence" 
system that puts generative AI at the heart of the Apple device ecosystem. However, it only works with the latest and greatest Apple devices. Apple Intelligence 
introduces solid improvements to Siri, the virtual assistant on iPhones and iPads. The new Siri has been supercharged with AI, and it understands context, so you don’t
have to repeat information. Apple says, "*Siri will be able to find and understand things that it never could before.*" For instance, if you are filling in a form asking
for your driving license number, Siri will automatically be able to find a picture of your driving license and extract the relevant number to fill in the field on your 
behalf.
