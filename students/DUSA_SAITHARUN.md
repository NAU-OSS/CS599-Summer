** Description : **

This study focuses on the effects of using React JS in web development to improve the user experience. React JS, created by Facebook, has become widely popular because of its component-based structure and virtual DOM rendering. The goal of this research is to examine different aspects of implementing React JS and how it affects the responsiveness, interactivity, and overall satisfaction of the user interface (UI).

In recent years, web development has seen a noticeable shift towards more dynamic and interactive UIs. Traditional methods often involve complicated manipulation and management of the DOM, which can lead to performance issues and difficulties in maintaining the code. React JS addresses these problems by introducing a declarative and component-based approach, allowing developers to efficiently create web applications that are interactive and responsive.

The research methodology for this study includes reviewing existing literature, conducting experiments, and collecting feedback from users. Performance metrics such as page load time, rendering speed, and memory usage were measured and compared between traditional JavaScript frameworks and React JS. Users reported higher satisfaction and perceived usability when using React JS, highlighting its positive impact on enhancing the user experience.
