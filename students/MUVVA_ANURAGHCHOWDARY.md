#### Jaora town in Madhya Pradesh’s Ratlam district was tense on Friday after body parts of a bovine were allegedly found to have been thrown on the premises of a local temple.

Police said two men were arrested in connection with the incident, and the local administration razed “illegal” portions of their houses.

Local groups also came out in protest against the alleged desecration of the temple.

The accused were identified as Salman Mevati (24) and Shaqir Qureshi (19). Police said they were arrested for “hurting religious sentiments”.

“Two bike-borne miscreants threw body parts of a bovine animal on the temple premises, following which the police traced and arrested them for hurting religious sentiments and under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC),” Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Manoj Kumar Singh said.

Ratlam Superintendent of Police Rakesh Khaka said the incident took place “on the intervening night of June 13 and 14, when at 2.41 am, two bike-borne men threw cow meat inside the temple premises”.
